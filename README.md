## Design Choices:
### **Database Design:**
I chose SQLite3 for its simplicity and compatibility during development. For a production environment, I would consider upgrading to a more robust database like PostgreSQL.

### **Template Structure:**
The use of Django templates with a base file (`base.html`) ensures consistency across pages, making it easier to maintain and update the site.

### **User Experience:**
A responsive design was prioritized to ensure usability across devices. Bootstrap was considered for styling but ultimately I opted for custom CSS to have more control over the look and feel.

### **Checkout and Payment:**
Currently, the checkout process stops short of integrating a live payment gateway due to time constraints. However, the design allows for easy integration with services like Stripe or PayPal in the future.

## Challenges and Considerations:
### **Design Challenges:**
- Balancing functionality with simplicity was a key challenge. I aimed to provide enough features for users without overwhelming them.
- Security was a major consideration. I implemented Django's authentication system and plan to add HTTPS and secure session management in the future.

### **Future Improvements:**
- **Payment Integration**: Implementing live payment options for a complete e-commerce experience.
- **Search Optimization**: Improving the search and filtering system for better performance.
- **Performance**: Optimizing database queries and reducing load times with caching.
- **Deployment**: Moving to a cloud platform for wider accessibility and scalability.
